    1. Define Variable:
In programming, a variable is a named storage location that can hold data. It is used to store and manipulate values, which can be of various types, such as numbers, text, or objects. Variables can be assigned values and their content can change during the execution of a program.

2. Difference between snake_case and camelCase:

snake_case: In snake_case, words are separated by underscores (_) and all letters are lowercase. For example: my_variable_name or user_input_value.
camelCase: In camelCase, words are joined without spaces, and the first letter of each word (except the first one) is capitalized. For example: myVariableName or userInputValue.
3. What is meant by integer division:
Integer division, sometimes referred to as floor division, is a division operation that results in an integer quotient, discarding any fractional part. In many programming languages, including Python, the division operator / between two integers performs integer division. For example, 7 / 3 would result in 2 (with the remainder truncated).

# Without Temporary Var

# num1 = int(input("enter the first number: "))
# num2 = int(input("enther the second number: "))

# num1, num2 = num2 , num1

# print("after Swapping: ")
# print("first number: ", num1)
# print("second number: ", num2)

# With a Temporary Var

# num1 = int(input("enter the first number: "))
# num2 = int(input("enther the second number: "))

# temp = num1
# num1 = num2
# num2 = temp

# print("After swapping:")
# print("First number:", num1)
# print("Second number:", num2)


# Program To Accept a String Value Via User Input And Display it 

# user_input = input("enter a string: ")

# print("you entered:",user_input)


# program to find the average marks for three subjects

# subject1 = float(input("Enter marks for subject 1: "))
# subject2 = float(input("Enter marks for subject 2: "))
# subject3 = float(input("Enter marks for subject 3: "))


# average = (subject1 + subject2 + subject3) / 3



# print("Average marks:", average)
