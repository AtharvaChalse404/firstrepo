# Initial velocity in meters per second (m/s)
v_initial = 0

# Final velocity in meters per second (m/s)
v_final = 10

# Time in seconds (s)
time = 20

# Calculate acceleration using the formula
acceleration = (v_final - v_initial) / time

# Output the result
print("Acceleration of the car:", acceleration, "m/s^2")
