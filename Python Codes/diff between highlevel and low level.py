    Difference between High-level and Low-level Programming Language:

High-level programming language: These languages are designed to be closer to human language and are easier to read and write. They offer a higher level of abstraction, with built-in functions and data structures that simplify programming tasks. High-level languages are more portable and independent of the hardware they run on. Examples include Python, Java, and C++.
Low-level programming language: These languages are closer to machine code and hardware. They provide minimal abstraction and often involve writing code that directly interacts with hardware components. Low-level languages are less portable and are highly dependent on the underlying architecture. Examples include Assembly language and machine code.
Description of Python Programming Language:
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and dynamically typed programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Here are some key features and characteristics of Python:

Readability: Python's syntax is clear and concise, making it easy for developers to write and maintain code.
Versatility: Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
Large Standard Library: Python comes with an extensive standard library that provides modules and functions for a wide range of tasks, reducing the need for external dependencies.
Interpreted: Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter, allowing for easy debugging and testing.
Dynamic Typing: You don't need to declare variable types; Python infers them at runtime.
Cross-Platform: Python is available on various operating systems, making it highly portable.
Community and Ecosystem: Python has a large and active community that has developed numerous third-party libraries and frameworks for various purposes.
Open Source: Python is open source and free to use, encouraging collaboration and contributions from the developer community.
Platform-Independent Programming Language:
A platform-independent programming language, often referred to as a cross-platform language, is a language that can run on multiple operating systems and hardware architectures without modification. It achieves platform independence through techniques like interpretation or virtualization. Python is a good example of a platform-independent language because you can write Python code on one platform (e.g., Windows) and run it on another platform (e.g., macOS or Linux) without significant changes, as long as the necessary interpreter or runtime environment is available for that platform. This portability is one of the reasons why Python is a popular choice for cross-platform development.
